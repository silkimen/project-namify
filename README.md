# project-namify
This tool is for those searching a cool working name for their project. It's a small tribute to mpj - Mattias Petter Johansson (have look on his youtube channel funfunfunction)!

Install with `npm install project-namify -g` and then just run `project-namify` to get an awesome project name (based on Intel codenames).
